 </span>Mryna Brill intended to ride the
god-car above the rain mist. For a
long time she had not believed in
the taboos or the Earth-god. She no
longer believed she lived on Earth.
This paradise of green-floored forests
and running brooks was something
called Rythar.</p>

<p>Six years ago, when Mryna was
fourteen, she first discovered the
truth. She asked a question and the
Earth-god ignored it. A simple question,
really: What is above the rain
mist? God could have told her. Every
day he answered technical questions
that were far more difficult. Instead,
he repeated the familiar taboo about
avoiding the Old Village because of
the Sickness.</p>

<p>And consequently Mryna, being
female, went to the Old Village.
There was nothing really unusual
about that. All the kids went through
the ruins from time to time. They
had worked out a sort of charm that
made it all right. They ran past the
burned out shells of the old houses
and they kept their eyes shaded to
ward off the Sickness.</p>

<p>But even at fourteen Mryna had
outgrown charms and she didn&#8217;t believe
in the Sickness. She had once
asked the Earth-god what sickness
meant, and the screen in the answer
house had given her a very detailed
answer. Mryna knew that none of the
hundred girls and thirty boys inhabiting
Rythar had ever been sick.
That, like the taboo of the Old Village,
she considered a childish superstition.</p>

<p>The Old Village wasn&#8217;t large&mdash;three
parallel roads, a mile long,
lined with the charred ruins of prefabs,
which were exactly like the
cottages where the kids lived. It was
nothing to inspire either fear or
legend. The village had burned a
long time ago; the grass from the
forest had grown a green mantle over
the skeletal walls.</p>

<p>For weeks Mryna poked through
the ruins before she found anything
of significance&mdash;a few, scorched
pages of a printed pamphlet buried
deep in the black earth. The paper
excited her tremendously. It was
different from the film books photographed
in the answer house. She
had never touched anything like it;
and it seemed wonderful stuff.</p>

<p>She read the pamphlet eagerly. It
was part of a promotional advertisement
of a world called Rythar, &ldquo;the
jewel of the Sirian Solar System.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The description made it obvious
that Rythar was the green paradise
where Mryna lived&mdash;the place she
had been taught to call Earth. And
the pamphlet had been addressed to
&ldquo;Earthmen everywhere.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Mryna made her second find when
she was fifteen, a textbook in astronomy.
For the first time in her life
she read about the spinning dust of
the universe lying beyond the eternal
rain mist that hid her world.</p>

<p>The solid, stable Earth of her
childhood was solid and stable no
longer, but a sphere turning through
a black void. Nor was it properly
called Earth, but a planet named
Rythar. The adjustment Mryna had
<a name="png.003" id="png.003"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to make was shattering; she lost faith
in everything she believed.</p>

<p>Yet the clock-work logic of astronomy
appealed to her orderly
mind. It explained why the rain mist
glowed with light during the day
and turned dark at night. Mryna had
never seen a clear sky. She had no
visual data to tie her new concept to.</p>

<p>For six years she kept the secret.
She hid the papers and the astronomy
text which she found in the Old
Village. Later, after the metal men
came, she destroyed everything so
none of the other women would
know the Earth-god was a man.</p>

<p>At first she kept the secret because
she was afraid. For some reason the
man who played at being god wanted
the kids to believe Rythar was Earth,
the totality of the universe enveloped
in a cloud of mist. She knew that
because she once asked god what a
planet was. The face on the screen
in the answer house became frigid
with anger&mdash;or was it fear?&mdash;and
the Earth-god said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word means nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But late that night a very large
god-car brought six metal men down
through the rain mist. They were
huge, jointed things that clanked
when they walked. Four of them
used weapons to herd the kids together
in their small settlement. The
two others went to the Old Village
and blasted the ruins with high explosives.</p>

<p>Vaguely Mryna remembered that
the metal men had been there before,
when the kids were still very
small. They had built the new settlement
and they had brought food.
They lived with the children for a
long time, she thought&mdash;but the
memory was hazy.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Mryna&#8217;s fear
retreated and only one thing became
important: she knew the Earth-god
was a man. On the fertile soil of
Rythar there were one hundred
women and thirty men. All the boys
had taken mates before they reached
seventeen. Seventy girls were left
unmarried, with no prospect of ever
having husbands. A score or more
became second wives in polygamous
homes, but plural marriage had no
appeal for Mryna. She was firmly
determined to possess a man of her
own. And why shouldn&#8217;t it be the
Earth-god?</p>

<p>As her first step toward escape,
Mryna volunteered for duty in the
answer house. For as long as she
could remember, the answer house
had stood on a knoll some distance
beyond the new settlement. It was
a square, one-room building, housing
a speaking box, a glass screen and
a console of transmission machinery.
Anyone in the settlement could contact
god and request information or
special equipment.</p>

<p>God went out of his way to deluge
them with information. The simplest
question produced voluminous data,
transmitted over the screen and photographed
on reels of film. Someone
had to be in the answer house to
handle the photography. The work
was not hard, but it was monotonous.
Most of the kids preferred to farm
the fields or dig the sacrificial ore.</p>

<p><a name="png.004" id="png.004"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>A request for equipment was
granted just as promptly. Tools, machines,
seeds, fertilizers, packaged
buildings, games, clothing&mdash;everything
came in a god-car. It was a
large cylinder which hissed down
from the rain mist on a pillar of fire.
The landing site was a flat, charred
field near the answer house. Unless
the equipment was unusually heavy,
the attendant stationed in the house
was expected to unload the god-car
and pile aboard the sacrifice ores
mined on Rythar.</p>

<p>God asked two things from the
settlement: the pieces of unusually
heavy metal which they dug from
the hills, and tiny vials of soil. In
an hour&#8217;s time they could mine
enough ore to fill the compartment
of a god-car, and god never complained
if they sometimes sent the
cylinder back empty. But he fussed
mightily over the small vials of
Earth. He gave very explicit directions
as to where they were to take
the samples, and the place was never
the same. Sometimes they had to
travel miles from the settlement to
satisfy that inexplicable whim.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />For two weeks Mryna patiently
ran off the endless films of new
books and unloaded the god-car
when it came. She examined the
interior of the cylinder carefully and
she weighed every possible risk. The
compartment was very small, but she
concluded that she would be safe.</p>

<p>And so she made her decision.
Tense and tight-lipped Mryna Brill
slipped aboard the god-car. She
sealed the lock door, which automatically
fired the launching tubes.
After that there was no turning back.</p>

<p>The dark compartment shook in
a thunder of sound. The weight of
the escape speed tore at her body,
pulling her tight against the confining
walls. She lost consciousness until
the pressure lessened.</p>

<p>The metal walls became hot but
the space was too confining for her
to avoid contact entirely. Four narrow
light tubes came on, with a dull,
red glow, and suddenly a gelatinous
liquid emptied out of ceiling vents.
The fluid sprayed every exposed surface
in the cubicle, draining through
the shipment of sacrifice ores at
Mryna&#8217;s feet. It had a choking, antiseptic
odor; it stung Mryna&#8217;s face
and inflamed her eyes.</p>

<p>Worse still, as the liquid soaked
into her clothing, it disintegrated the
fiber, tearing away the cloth in long
strips which slowly dissolved in the
liquid on the floor. Before the antiseptic
spray ceased, Mryna was helplessly
naked. Even her black boots
had not survived.</p>

<p>The red lights went out and
Mryna was imprisoned again in the
crushing darkness. A terror of the
taboos she had defied swept her
mind. She began to scream, but the
sound was lost in the roar of the
motors.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was over. The god-car
lurched into something hard. Mryna
was thrown against the ceiling&mdash;and
she hung there, weightless. The
pieces of sacrifice ore were floating
in the darkness just as she was. The
<a name="png.005" id="png.005"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>motors cut out and the lock door
swung open.</p>

<p>Mryna saw a circular room,
brightly lighted with a glaring, blue
light. The nature of her fear
changed. This was the house of the
Earth-god, but she could not let him
find her naked.</p>

<p>She tried to run into the circular
room. She found that the slightest
exertion of her muscles sent her
spinning through the air. She could
not get her feet on the floor. There
was no down and no up in that
room. She collided painfully with
the metal wall and she snatched at
a light bracket to keep herself from
bouncing free in the empty air again.</p>

<p>The god-car had landed against
what was either the ceiling or the
floor of the circular room. Mryna
had no way of making a differentiation.
Eight brightly lighted corridors
opened into the side walls. Mryna
heard footsteps moving toward her
down one of the corridors; she pulled
herself blindly into another. As
she went farther from the circular
room, a vague sense of gravity returned.
At the end of the corridor
she was able to stand on her feet
again, although she still had to walk
very carefully. Any sudden movement
sent her soaring in a graceful
leap that banged her head against
the ceiling.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Cautiously she opened a thick,
metal door into another hall&mdash;and
she stood transfixed, looking through
a mica wall at the emptiness of space
pinpointed with its billions of stars.
This was the reality of the charts
she had seen in the astronomy text:
that knowledge alone saved her
sanity. She had believed it when the
proof lay hidden above the rain mist;
she must believe it now.</p>

<p>From where she stood, she was
able to see the place where the god-car
had brought her&mdash;like a vast cartwheel
spinning in the void. The god-car
was clamped against the hub,
from which eight corridors radiated
outward like wheel spokes toward
the rim. Far below the gigantic
wheel Mryna saw the sphere of
Rythar, invisible behind its shroud
of glowing mist.</p>

<p>She moved along the rim corridor,
past the mica wall, until she came
to a door that stood open. The room
beyond was a sleeping compartment
and it was empty. She searched it for
clothing, and found nothing. She
went through four more dormitory
rooms before she came upon anything
she could use&mdash;brief shorts,
clearly made for a man, and a loose,
white tunic. It wasn&#8217;t suitable; it
wasn&#8217;t the way she wanted to be
dressed when she faced him. But it
had to do.</p>

<p>Mryna was pawing through a
footlocker looking for boots when
she heard a hesitant step behind her.
She whirled and saw a small, stooped,
white-haired man, naked except
for trunks like the ones she was
wearing. The wrinkled skin on his
wasted chest was burned brown by
the hot glare of the sun. Thick-lensed
glasses hung from a chain
around his neck.</p>

<p><a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said in
a tired voice, &ldquo;this is a men&#8217;s ward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be a new patient.&rdquo; He
fumbled for his glasses. Instinctively
she knew she shouldn&#8217;t let him see
her clearly enough to identify her
as a stranger. She shoved past him,
knocking the glasses from his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d better find my own&mdash;ward.&rdquo;
Mryna didn&#8217;t know the word, but
she supposed it meant some sort of
sleeping chamber.</p>

<p>The old man said chattily, &ldquo;I
hadn&#8217;t heard they were bringing in
any new patients today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in the corridor by that
time. He reached for her hand. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll
see you in the sunroom?&rdquo; It was a
timid, hopeful question. &ldquo;And you&#8217;ll
tell me all the news&mdash;everything
they&#8217;re doing back on Earth. I
haven&#8217;t been home for almost a
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fled down the hall. When she
heard voices ahead of her, she pulled
back a door and slid into another
room&mdash;a storeroom piled with cases
of medicines. Behind the cartons she
thought she would be safe.</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t what she had expected.
Mryna thought there might be
one man living in a kind of prefab
somehow suspended above the rain
mist. But there were obviously others
up here; she didn&#8217;t know how many.
And the old man frightened her&mdash;more
than the dazzling sight of the
heavens visible through the mica
wall. Mryna had never seen physical
age before. No one on Rythar was
older than she was herself&mdash;a sturdy,
healthy, lusty twenty. The old man&#8217;s
infirmity disgusted her; for the first
time in her life she was conscious of
the slow decay of death.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The door of the supply room slid
open. Mryna crouched low behind
the cartons, but she was able to see
the man and the woman who had
entered the room. A woman&mdash;here?
Mryna hadn&#8217;t considered that possibility.
Perhaps the Earth-god already
had a mate.</p>

<p>The newcomers were dressed in
crisp, white uniforms; the woman
wore a starched, white hat. They
carried a tray of small, glass cylinders
from which metal needles projected.
While the woman held the tray, the
man drove the needles through the
caps of small bottles and filled the
cylinders with a bright-colored
liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you leaving, Dick?&rdquo;
the woman asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about forty minutes. They&#8217;re
sending an auto-pickup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&#8217;t start worrying. They
have got the bugs out of it by this
time. The auto-pickups are entirely
trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&#8217;s what the army says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In theory they should be even
more reliable than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&#8217;d wait for the hospital
shuttle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And miss the chance to address
Congress this year? We&#8217;ve worked
too long for this; I don&#8217;t want to
muff it now. We&#8217;ve all the statistical
proof we need, even to convince
<a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>those pinchpenny halfwits. During
the past eight years we&#8217;ve handled
more than a thousand cases up here.
On Earth they were pronounced incurable;
we&#8217;ve sent better than
eighty per cent back in good health
after an average stay of fourteen
months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No medical man has ever questioned
the efficiency of cosmic radiation
and a reduced atmospheric gravity,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s just our so-called statesmen,
always yapping about the budget. But
this time we have the cost problem
licked, too. For a year and a half
the ore they send up from Rythar
has paid for our entire operation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve kept it under wraps, so
the politicians wouldn&#8217;t cut our appropriations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their glass tubes were full, and
they turned toward the door. &ldquo;It
isn&#8217;t right,&rdquo; the woman persisted,
&ldquo;for them not to send a piloted
shuttle after you, Dick. It isn&#8217;t dignified.
You&#8217;re our assistant medical
director and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words were cut off as the door
slid shut behind them. Mryna tried
to fit this new information into what
she already knew&mdash;or thought she
knew&mdash;about the Earth-god. It didn&#8217;t
add up to a pretty picture. She had
once asked for a definition of illness,
and it was apparent to her that this
place which they called the Guardian
Wheel was an expensive hospital for
Earthmen. It was paid for by the
sacrificial ores mined on Rythar. In
a sense, Rythar was being enslaved
and exploited by Earth. True, it was
not difficult to dig out the ore, but
Mryna resented the fact that the kids
on Rythar had not been told the
truth. She had long ago lost her
awe of the man called god; now she
lost her respect as well.</p>

<p>Mryna was glad she had not seen
him, glad no one knew she was
aboard the Guardian Wheel. She
would return to Rythar. After she
told the others what she knew,
Rythar would send up no more sacrifice
ores. Let the Earthmen come
down and mine it for themselves!</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Very cautiously she pulled the
door open. The rim corridor was
empty. She moved toward one of
the intersecting corridors. When she
heard footsteps, she hid in another
dormitory room.</p>

<p>This was different from the others.
It showed more evidence of permanent
occupation. She guessed it was
a dormitory for the people who took
care of the sick. Pictures were fastened
to the curved, metal walls. Personal
articles cluttered the shelves
hung beside the bunks. On a writing
desk she saw a number of typed
reports. Five freshly laundered uniforms,
identical to the one she had
lost in the antiseptic wash, hung on
a rack behind the door. Mryna stripped
off the makeshift she was wearing
and put on one of the uniforms;
she found boots under the desk.
When she was dressed, she stood
admiring herself in the polished surface
of the metal door.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman, and
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>she was very conscious of that. Her
face was tanned by the mist-filtered
sunlight of Rythar; her lips were red
and sensuous; her long, platinum-colored
hair fell to her shoulders.
She compared herself to the small,
hard-faced female she had seen in
the supply room. Was that a typical
Earthwoman? Mryna&#8217;s lips curled in
a scornful smile. Let the gods come
down to Rythar, then, and discover
what a real female was like in the
lush, green, Rytharian paradise.</p>

<p>Mryna went to the desk and
glanced at the typed reports. They
had been written by a man who signed
himself &ldquo;Commander in Charge,
Guardian Wheel,&rdquo; and they were
addressed to the Congress of the
world government. One typed document
was a supply inventory; a second,
still unfinished, was a budget
report. (<em>You won&#8217;t show a profit
next time</em>, Mryna thought vindictively,
<em>when we stop sending you the
sacrifice ore</em>.) Another report dealt
with Rythar, and Mryna read it with
more interest.</p>

<p>One paragraph caught her attention,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have asked for soil samples
to be taken from an area covering
ten thousand square miles. Our
chemical analysis has been thorough,
and we find nothing that could be
remotely harmful to human life.
Atmospheric samples produce the
same negative results. On the other
hand, we have direct evidence that
no animal life has ever evolved on
Rythar; the life cycle is exclusively
botanical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soil samples, Mryna realized,
would be the vials of Earth which
the Earth-god had requested so often.
Were the Earthmen planning to
move their hospital down to Rythar?
That idea disturbed her. Mryna did
not want her garden world cluttered
up with a lot of sick, old men discarded
by Earth.</p>

<p>She turned to the second page of
the report. &ldquo;The original colony survived
for a year. The Sickness in the
Old Village developed only after
the first harvest of Rytharian-grown
food. It is more and more evident
that the botanical cycle of Rythar
must be examined before we find
the answer. To do that adequately,
we shall have to send survey teams
to the surface; that requires much
larger appropriations for research
than we have had in the past. The
metal immunization suits, which
must, of course, be destroyed after
each expedition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what, may I ask, is the
meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Mryna dropped the report and
swung toward the door. She saw a
woman standing there&mdash;another
hard-faced Earthwoman, with a
starched, white cap perched on her
graying hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have come to the wrong
room,&rdquo; Mryna said in a small voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Everyone knows this is
command headquarters. Who are
you?&rdquo; The woman put her hand on
Mryna&#8217;s arm, and the fingers bit
through the uniform into Mryna&#8217;s
flesh.</p>

<p><a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mryna pulled away, drawing her
shoulders back proudly. Why should
she feel afraid? She stood a head
taller than this dried up stranger;
she knew the Earthwoman&#8217;s strength
would be no match for hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Mryna Brill,&rdquo; she
said quietly. &ldquo;I came up in a god-car
from Rythar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rythar?&rdquo; The woman&#8217;s mouth
fell open. She whispered the word
as if it were profanity. Suddenly she
turned and ran down the rim corridor,
screaming in terror.</p>

<p><em>She&#8217;s afraid of me</em>! Mryna thought.
And that made no sense at all.</p>

<p>Mryna knew she had to get back
to the god-car quickly. Since the
Earthmen had built up the taboos in
order to get their sacrifice ores from
Rythar, they would do everything
they could to prevent her return. She
ran toward an intersecting spoke corridor.
An alarm bell began to clang,
and the sound vibrated against the
metal walls. An armed man sprang
from a side room and fired his weapon
at Mryna. The discharge burned
a deep groove in the wall.</p>

<p>So they would even kill her&mdash;these
men who pretended to be gods!</p>

<p>Before the man could fire again,
Mryna swung down a side corridor,
and at once the sensation of weightlessness
overtook her. She could not
move quickly. She saw the armed
man at the mouth of the corridor.
Frantically she pushed open the door
of a room, which was crowded
with consoles of transmission machines.
Three men were seated in
front of the speakers. They jumped
and came toward her, clumsily fighting
the weightlessness.</p>

<p>Mryna caught at the door jamb
and swung herself toward the ceiling.
At the same time the armed man
fired. The discharge missed her and
washed against the transmission machinery.
Blue fire exploded from the
room. The three men screamed in
agony. Concussion threw Mryna helplessly
toward the rim again.</p>

<p>And the Guardian Wheel was
plunged into darkness. Mryna&#8217;s head
swam; her shoulder seethed with pain
where she had banged into the wall.
She tried to creep toward the circular
room, but she had lost her sense of
direction and she found herself back
on the rim.</p>

<p>The clanging bell had stopped
when the lights went out, but Mryna
heard the panic of frightened voices.
Far away someone was screaming.
Running feet clattered toward her.
Mryna flattened herself against the
outer wall. An indistinct body of
men shot past her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Rythar,&rdquo; one of them was
saying. &ldquo;A woman from Rythar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&#8217;ve blasted the communication
center. We&#8217;ve no way of sending
the warning back to Earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were gone.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Mryna moved back into the spoke
corridor. She felt her way silently
toward the circular hub room and the
god-car. Suddenly very close she
heard voices which she recognized&mdash;the
man and the woman who had
been talking in the supply room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re still all right, Dick,&rdquo; the
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>woman said. &ldquo;She hasn&#8217;t been here
long enough to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t know that. We don&#8217;t
know how it spreads or how quickly.
We can&#8217;t take the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then &hellip; then we&#8217;ve no choice?&rdquo;
Her voice was a small whisper,
choked with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. These have been standing
emergency orders for twenty years.
We always faced the possibility that
one of them would escape. If we&#8217;d
been allowed to use a different policy
of education&mdash;but the politicians
wouldn&#8217;t permit that. The Wheel has
to be destroyed, and we must die
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&#8217;t we wait and make
sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It works too fast. None of us
would be able to do the job&mdash;afterward.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The voices moved away. Mryna
floated toward the hub room. She
found the air lock and pulled herself
into the god-car. The metal lock
hissed closed and light came on.
Then she knew she had made a
mistake. This ship was not the one
she had used when she came up
from Rythar. The tiny cabin was
fitted with a sleeping lounge, a food
cabinet and a file of reading films.
Above the lounge a mica viewplate
gave her a broad view of the sky.</p>

<p>Mryna remembered that the man
in the supply room had said he was
waiting for an auto-pickup; he was
on his way back to Earth. Mryna had
taken his ship instead of her own.
In panic she tried to open the door
again, but she found no way to do
it. Machinery beneath her feet began
to hum. She felt a slight lurch as
the pickup left the hub of the Guardian
Wheel.</p>

<p>It swung in a wide arc. Through
the viewplate she saw the enormous
Wheel growing small behind her,
silhouetted against the mist of Rythar.
Suddenly the wheel glowed red with
a soundless explosion. Its flaming
fragments died in the void.</p>

<p>Mryna dropped weakly on the
lounge. Nausea spun through her
mind. The man had said they would
destroy themselves. Because Mryna
had come aboard? But why were they
afraid of her? What possible harm
could she do them? Mryna had left
Rythar to discover the truth, and the
truth was insanity. Was truth always
like this&mdash;a bitter disillusionment,
an empty horror?</p>

<p>She had something else to say to
the people of Rythar now: not that
the gods were men, but that men
were mad. Believe in the taboos;
send up the sacrificial ores. It was a
small price to pay to keep that madness
away from Rythar.</p>

<p>And Mryna knew she could not go
back. With the Wheel gone, she
could never return to Rythar; the
auto-pickup was carrying her inexorably
toward Earth. The scream of
the machinery slowly turned shrill,
hammering against her eardrums.
The stars visible in the viewplate
blurred and winked out. Mryna felt
a twist of vertigo as the shuttle
shifted from conventional speed into
a time warp. And then the sound
<a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was gone. The ship was floating in
an impenetrable blackness.</p>

<p>Mryna had no idea how much
time passed subjectively. When she
became hungry, she took food from
the cabinet. She slept when she was
tired. To pass the time, she turned
the reading films through the projector.</p>

<p>Most of the film stored in the
shuttle covered material Mryna already
knew. The Earthmen, clearly,
had not denied any information to
Rythar. Only one thing had been restricted&mdash;astronomy.
And that would
have made no difference, if Mryna
had not found the text in the ruins
of the Old Village. The people on
Rythar never saw the stars; they had
no way of knowing&mdash;or caring&mdash;what
lay above the rain mist.</p>

<p>Mryna was more interested in the
history of Earth, which she had
never known before. She studied the
pictures of the great industrial centers
and the crowded countryside.
She was awed by the mobs in the
city streets and the towering buildings.
Yet she liked her own world
more&mdash;the forests and the clear-running
brooks; the vast, uncrowded,
open spaces.</p>

<p>It puzzled her that the people of
Earth would give the Rytharian paradise
to a handful of children, when
their own world was so overcrowded.
Was this another form of the madness
that had driven the people in
the Wheel to destroy themselves?
That made a convenient explanation,
yet Mryna&#8217;s mind was too logical to
accept it.</p>

<p>One film referred to the founding
of the original colony on Rythar, a
planet in the Sirian System which
had been named for its discoverer.
Rythar, according to the film, was
one of a score of colonies established
by Earth. It was unbelievably rich
in deposits of uranium.</p>

<p>That, Mryna surmised, was the
name of the sacrificial ore they sent
up in the god-cars.</p>

<p>The atmosphere and gravity of
Rythar duplicated that of Earth;
Rythar should have become the
largest colony in the system. The
government of Earth had originally
planned a migration of ten million
persons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But after twelve months the
survey colony was destroyed by an
infection,&rdquo; Mryna read on the projection
screen, &ldquo;which has never been
identified. It is called simply the
Sickness. The origin of this plague
is unknown. No adult in the survey
colony survived; children born on
Rythar are themselves immune, but
are carriers of the Sickness. The first
rescue team sent to save them died
within eight hours. No human being,
aside from these native-born children,
has ever survived the Sickness.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Now Mryna had the whole truth.
She knew the motivation for their
madness of self-destruction. It was
not insanity, but the sublime courage
of a few human beings sacrificing
themselves to save the rest of their
civilization. They smashed the
Guardian Wheel to keep the Sickness
there. And Mryna had already
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>escaped before that happened! She
was being hurled through space toward
Earth and she would destroy
that, too.</p>

<p>If she killed herself, that would
in no way alter the situation. The
ship would still move in its appointed
course. Her body would be
aboard; perhaps the very furnishings
in the cabin were now infected with
the germ of the Sickness. When the
ship touched Earth, the fatal poison
would escape.</p>

<p>Dully Mryna turned up another
frame on the film, and she read
what the Earthmen had done to help
Rythar. They built the Guardian
Wheel to isolate the Sickness. Sealed
in metal immunization suits, volunteers
had descended to the plague
world and reared the surviving children
of the colonists until they were
old enough to look out for themselves.
The answer house had been
set up as an instructional device.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As nearly as possible, the scientists
in charge attempted to create
a normal social situation for the
plague carriers. They could never be
allowed to leave Rythar, but when
they matured enough to know the
truth, Rythar could be integrated
into the colonial system. Rytharian
uranium is already a significant trade
factor in the colonial market. An
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
  original reads 'incidential'">incidental</ins> by-product of the Guardian
Wheel is the hospital facility,
where advanced cases of certain
cancers and lung diseases have been
cured in a reduced gravity or by
exposure to cosmic radiation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mryna shut off the projection. The
words made sense, but the results did
not. And she knew precisely why
Earth had failed. When they matured&mdash;in
those three words she had her
answer.</p>

<p>And now it didn&#8217;t matter. There
was nothing she could do. Her ship
was a poisoned arrow aimed directly
at the heart of man&#8217;s civilization.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Mryna had slept twice when the
auto-pickup lurched out of the time
drive and she was able to see the
stars again. Directly ahead of her
she saw an emerald planet, bright in
the sun. And she knew instinctively
that it was Earth.</p>

<p>A speaker under the viewport
throbbed with the sound of a human
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auto-shuttle SC&nbsp;539, attention.
You are assigned landing slot seven-three-one,
Port Chicago. I repeat,
seven-three-one. Dial that destination.
Do you read me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three times the message was repeated
before Mryna concluded that
it was meant for her. She found three
small knobs close to the speaker and
a plastic toggle labeled &ldquo;voice reply.&rdquo;
She snapped it shut and found that
she could speak to the Chicago spaceport.</p>

<p>Her problem was easily solved,
then. She could say she came from
Rythar. Without hesitation, Earth
ships would be sent to blast her ship
out of the sky before she would be
able to land. But she knew she had
to accomplish more than that; the
same mistake must not be repeated
again.</p>

<p><a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;How much time do I have?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-four minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you keep this shuttle up here
any longer than that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady, the auto-pickups are on
tape-pilot. Come hell or high water,
they land exactly on schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens if I don&#8217;t dial the
slot destination?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We bring you in on emergency&mdash;and
you fork over a thousand buck
fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mryna asked to be allowed to
speak to someone in authority in the
government. The Chicago port manager
told her the request was absurd.
For nine minutes Mryna argued,
with a mounting sense of urgency,
before he gave his grudging consent.
Her trouble was that she had
to skate close to the truth without
admitting it directly. She could not&mdash;except
as a last resort&mdash;let them
kill her until they knew why the
isolation of Rythar had failed.</p>

<p>It was thirteen minutes before
landing when Mryna finally heard
an older, more dignified voice on
the speaker. By then the green globe
of Earth filled the sky; Mryna could
make out the shapes of the continents
turning below her. The older man
identified himself as a senator elected
to the planetary Congress. She didn&#8217;t
know how much authority he represented,
but she couldn&#8217;t afford to
wait any longer.</p>

<p>She told him frankly who she
was. She knew she was pronouncing
her own death sentence, yet she
spoke quietly. She must show the
same courage that the Earthmen had
when they sacrificed themselves in
the Guardian Wheel.</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />&ldquo;Listen to me for two minutes
more before you blast my ship,&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I rode the god-car up from
Rythar&mdash;I am coming now to spread
the Sickness on Earth&mdash;because I
wanted to know the truth about
something that puzzled me. I had to
know what was above the rain mist.
In the answer house you would not
tell us that. Now I understand why.
We were children. You were waiting
for us to mature. And that is the
mistake you made; that blindness
nearly destroyed your civilization.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to build another
Guardian Wheel. This time don&#8217;t
hide anything from us because we&#8217;re
children. The truth makes us mature,
not illusions or taboos. Never forget
that. It is easier to face a fact than
to have to give up a dream we&#8217;ve
been taught to believe. Tell your
children the truth when they ask for
it. Tell us, please. We can adjust
to it. We&#8217;re just as human as you
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mryna drew a long breath. Her
lips were trembling. Did this man
understand what she had tried to
say? She would never know. If she
failed, Earth&mdash;in spite of its generosity
and its courage&mdash;would one
day be destroyed by children bred on
too many delusions. &ldquo;I&#8217;m ready,&rdquo;
Mryna said steadily. &ldquo;Send up your
warships and destroy me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited. Less than ten minutes
were left. Her shuttle began to move
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>more slowly. She was no more than
a mile above Earth. She saw the
soaring cities and the white highways
twisting through green fields.</p>

<p>Seven minutes left. Where were
the warships? She looked anxiously
through the viewport and the sky
was empty.</p>

<p>Desperately she closed the voice
toggle again. &ldquo;Send them quickly!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;You must not let me
land!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No reply came from the speaker.
Her auto-shuttle began to circle a
large city which lay at the southern
tip of an inland lake. Three minutes
more. The ship nosed toward the
spaceport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you do something?&rdquo;
Mryna screamed. &ldquo;What are you
waiting for?&rdquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />The shuttle settled into a metal
rack. The lock hissed open. Mryna
shrank back against the wall, looking
out at what she would destroy&mdash;what
she had already destroyed. A
dignified, portly man came panting
up the ramp toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t
come in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Senator Brieson,&rdquo; he said
shortly. &ldquo;For ten years Dr. Jameson
has been telling us from the Guardian
Wheel that we should adopt a
different educational policy toward
Rythar. Your scare broadcast was
clever, but we&#8217;re used to Jameson&#8217;s
tricks. He&#8217;ll be removed from office
for this, and if I have anything to
say about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t believe me?&rdquo; Mryna
gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. If a plague carrier
escaped from Rythar, we would have
heard about it long before this. The
trouble with you scientists is you
don&#8217;t grant the rest of us any common
sense. And Jameson&#8217;s the worst
of the lot. He&#8217;s always contended
that the sociologists should determine
our Rytharian policy, not the elected
representatives of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mryna broke down and began to
cry hysterically. The senator put his
hand under her arm&mdash;none too gently.
&ldquo;Let&#8217;s have no more dramatics,
please. You don&#8217;t know how fortunate
you are, young lady. If the
politicians were as addle-witted as
you scientists claim we are, we might
have believed that nonsense and
blasted your ship out of the sky. You
scientists have to give up the notion
that you&#8217;re our guardians; we&#8217;re quite
able to look out for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
